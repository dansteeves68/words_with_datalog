# Words With Datalog

In 2010-11 I attempted to implement the rules of the popular mobile game Words With Friends in the language Datalog, using the version created & owned by my employer LogicBlox.

I never finished the project, but I did flesh out some interesting ideas about how to put this together. I'm publishing here for posterity and as part of my programmer's portfolio.

# Dependencies

To work with this at all you'll need a version of the LogicBlox executables for your platform. Since these are closed source, your best bet is to get in touch with me and I can help you contact LogicBlox.
