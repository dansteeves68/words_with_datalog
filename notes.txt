# Tile Placement:

- The first word must be placed so that 1 of the tiles is on the star in the
  center of the board.

- Every word following that must be placed so that at least 1 tile is shared
  from an existing word on the board.

- Tiles can only be placed in the same line vertically or horizontally each
  turn.

- Tiles can be placed so that multiple new words are formed simultaneously
  using neighboring letters.

- Words cannot be placed if they create an illegal word using neighboring
  letters.

- All words labelled as a part of speech (including those listed of foreign
  origin, and as archaic, obsolete, colloquial, slang, etc.) are permitted
  with the exception of the following: proper nouns (words always
  capitalized), abbreviations, prefixes and suffixes standing alone or words
  requiring a hyphen or an apostrophe.

# Scoring: 

- Double the value of any tiles that were played this turn on a DL space, and
  triple the value of any tile that was played on a TL space this turn.

- Do not double the value of tiles on DL and TL spaces for tiles that were
  played on previous rounds.

- Add up the values of all letters in the word, even if some were played on a
  previous turn.

- Double the value of the word if any tiles this turn were played on a DW
  space (and double it again in the case were 2 DW spaces were played upon).

- Triple the value of the word if any tiles this turn were played on a TW
  space (and triple it again if 2 TW spaces were used).

- Do not multiply words if tiles on DW or TW spaces were used from a previous
  turn.

- It is possible to create multiple words with the same play.

- In this case, score each new word separately, including bonuses, and sum all
  of the new words together.

- 35 bonus points are awarded whenever a player uses all 7 tiles on their rack
  in a single turn.

# End Game: 

- The game ends when one player plays every tile in his rack, and there are no
  tiles remaining to draw from.

- The game could also end if three successive turns have occurred with no
  scoring and as long as the score is not zero-zero.

- After the last tile is played, the opposing player will lose points equal to
  the sum of the value of his remaining tiles. This amount is then awarded to
  the player who placed the last tile.
